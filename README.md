It’s all about (the) IDE
The next step in your Flutter application development is to install an IDE (Integrated Development Environment). In theory, IDE is not needed and you can use only the SDK and any text editor for development. However, IDEs provide features like syntax highlighting, code completion, and debugger which are very helpful during the development process. In this tutorial, we will use Android Studio.

Flutter also provides official plugins for IntelliJ and Visual Studio Code. In case of Android Studio and IntelliJ, don’t forget to restart the IDE to activate the newly installed plugins (this is not needed for VS Code). Note that only stable versions of IDEs are supported, the Flutter plugin may not function properly on Beta, Canary, or EAP (Early Access Preview) builds.

Now it’s time to create a new project. On the welcome screen, choose Start a new Flutter Project and select Flutter Application on the next screen.
